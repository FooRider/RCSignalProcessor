# RCSignalProcessor
Mini project for processing standard RC signals on an arduino board, meant to extend functionality of RC models.

# Usage

Main value of this program is in its CppmInput and PwmInput classes, which
read CPPM or PWM inputs from interrupt pins (pins 2 or 3 on Arduino Nano).
This is implemented using interrupts, thus leaving main program loop free to
manage outputs.

To use this program, I suggest that you first uncomment serial debug messages 
and make sure that the program can read input from RC receiver and also to 
make note of values read.

Afterwards, you can comment out the debug messages and  modify main loop to 
your needs. A simple light pattern is pre-programmed.
